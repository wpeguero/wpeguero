### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Management at work.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Creating multiple libraries on books that I have been reading on, textbooks that I have from college, as well as online cookbooks in AI.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I actually started as a biomedical engineer with the goal of working in the Cell and Tissue Engineering field, but after learning MATLAB in my freshman year of College, I fell in love with the medical device industry and programming.
