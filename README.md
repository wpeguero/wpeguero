### Hi there my name is Wilson Peguero Rosario ðŸ‘‹

## I'm always open to learning something new and interesting.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Management at work.
- ðŸ”­ I"m currently working on a master's in Data Science at Grand Canyon University.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I actually started as a biomedical engineer with the goal of working in the Cell and Tissue Engineering field, but after learning MATLAB in my freshman year of College, I fell in love with the medical device industry and programming.

## About my Master's in Data Science
In my master's degree in Data Science, I expect the following:

 - Practicing how to apply statistical theories and methods in R.
 - Learning Data Science methodologies (i.e. Machine learning, data mining, data gathering, ETL Processes, etc.)
 - Learning to derive information and make decisions based on data.

## My core passion behind learning is researching cancer.

As my aunt died from cancer while I was at an early age, I decided to become a biomedical engineer. Life does not go exactly as planned, I have yet to exercise my biomedical degree to its full potential, but I am still aiming to work on cancer research. After working with data for some time, I realized that I loved the data aspect of research and drawing conclusions from said data more than anything which led to my master's in Data Science (work in progress).
